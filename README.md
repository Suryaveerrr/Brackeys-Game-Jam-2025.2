> **Hit. Stand. Buy Biscuits.**

**Crumble Jack** is our entry for the Brackeys Game Jam 2025.2. It takes the classic tension of Blackjack and adds a chaotic, roguelite-inspired shop system where "risking it" allows you to break the rules.

## 🃏 About The Game

This game was created in **one week** for the **Brackeys Game Jam 2025.2**.

### The Twist: "Risk it for the Biscuit"
In standard Blackjack, chips are just a score. In **Crumble Jack**, chips are ammo.
* **Win Chips:** By beating the dealer.
* **Spend Chips:** Between rounds, visit the Shop.
* **Buy Biscuits:** Powerful, single-use items that let you manipulate cards, swap hands, or force the dealer to bust.
